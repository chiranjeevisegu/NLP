# NLP Text Classification Project

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) notebook that demonstrates a complete text classification pipeline using machine learning. The project walks through essential NLP steps such as text preprocessing, vectorization, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix
- Sample prediction on custom input
