# NLP Text Classification Project

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) notebook that demonstrates a complete text classification pipeline using machine learning. The project guides users through essential NLP steps, including text preprocessing, vectorization, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Word2Vec form
- BERT embeddings
-  Label processing
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - BERT
  - Distil BERT
  - DeBERTa
- Model evaluation using Classification Report, confusion matrix
- Sample prediction on custom input
